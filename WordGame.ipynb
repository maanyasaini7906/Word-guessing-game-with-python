        " Developing a text-based word guessing game in Python where the computer randomly selects a secret word from a predefined list. The user repeatedly guesses the word, and after each guess, the program provides hints by indicating how many letters are correct and in the correct position. The game includes input validation, real-time feedback, and tracks the number of attempts taken to guess the correct word.\n",
